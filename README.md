# Google Front-End Project README

## Project Overview:

This project aims to replicate the front-end layout and functionality of Google's search engine, including its regular search, image search, and advanced search features. The website consists of three pages: index.html for regular Google Search, image.html for Google Image Search, and advanced.html for Google Advanced Search.

## Implementation Details:

## Page Structure:

- index.html: Contains the layout for regular Google Search.
- image.html: Displays the layout for Google Image Search.
- advanced.html: Implements the layout for Google Advanced Search.
- Navigation Links: All pages include navigation links in the upper-right corner for easy access to other sections.
  On the Google Search page (index.html), links to Image Search and Advanced Search are provided.
  On the Image Search and Advanced Search pages, a link to return to the Google Search page is included.
  Search Functionality:

### Google Search Page (index.html):

- Users can enter a query into the search bar and click "Google Search" to be directed to the search results page.
- The search bar and button are centered with rounded corners, following Google's aesthetics.

### Google Image Search Page (image.html):

- Users can input a query and click the search button to be redirected to Google Image search results.

### Google Advanced Search Page (advanced.html):

- Users can input specific search parameters in four fields, similar to Google's advanced search options.
- The fields are stacked vertically, and all text inputs are left-aligned, consistent with Google's design.

## Styling:

- CSS is designed to resemble Google's aesthetics, including font styles, button colors, and layout arrangements.
- The "Advanced Search" button is styled with blue background and white text, matching Google's design guidelines.
- I'm Feeling Lucky Button: Added an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page. Clicking this button directly redirects users to the first search result for their query, bypassing the regular results page.

Note: Users may encounter a redirect notice due to Google's security features, which is an expected behavior.

## Conclusion:

This project successfully replicates key features and aesthetics of Google's front-end design, providing users with a familiar interface for conducting searches. The implementation adheres closely to the provided specifications, ensuring a seamless user experience across all pages.
